# Use Helmet
Helmet can help protect your application from some well-known web vulnerabilities by configuring HTTP headers accordingly.

Helmet is actually just a collection of nine smaller middleware functions that configure security-related HTTP headers:
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: off
X-Download-Options: noopen
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
X-XSS-Protection: 0
